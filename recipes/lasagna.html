                        <br>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.

                        <br>Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                        <br>Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                        <br>Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 
                        <br>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
                        remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the 
                        bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                        <br>Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
